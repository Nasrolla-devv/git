## Authentication with Supabase and Secure Cookies

- Users login via the `/login` page using email and password.
- Credentials are sent to `/api/login` which uses the **Supabase Auth API** to authenticate the user.
- If login is successfull, Supabase internally sets a **secure cookie** with the session token.
- On future requests, Supabase reads the session from the cookie to identify the logged-in user.

Protected pages like `/profile` check for an authenticated session by calling the `/api/user` route.
If no valid session is found, the user is redirected to the login page.
The file `src/middleware.ts` ensures that the session is refreshed automatically on navigation, and is injected into both client and server routes.

## Mongo Atlas

All movie data uploaded to MongoDB Atlas was collected from TMDb (The Movie Database) using their API.

The data follows this structure:

```json
{
  "imdbId": "",
  "title": "",
	@@ -20,5 +117,54 @@ The data follows this structure:
    }
  ]
}
```

A total of 82 movie objects were uploaded to the database, based on a 3418-line JSON file retrieved and processed from TMDb.
